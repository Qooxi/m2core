## Information:
> A universal system with multiple applications, primarily helping in managing the surplus of individual items in the game, but not limited to. We can integrate this module into any activity within the game.

## Functionality
> The system can be integrated into various game activities such as:
>- strengthening/advancing specific items,
>- skill training,
>- accepting/completing missions,
>- activating/using items,

In reality, we can utilize it `wherever` possible.

> There are several options for integrating the system, either by calling a special namespace inside source-gamer with corresponding values such as:
>- required items,
>- required gold,
>- required rank,

Alternatively, for more advanced systems, an integrated parser for `.xml` files can be used.
